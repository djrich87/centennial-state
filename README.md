# Centennial State

## Background

When the development team came together for the first time we brainstormed about our commonalities and where we grew up. These common interests and backgrounds were used as ideas and themes for our Unit Three project. After about ten minutes we realized that every member liked video games and that we all grew up in the Great Lakes region of the Midwest. Our points of origin combined with  our passion for video games was the beginning of the Great Lakes Gamers! The Great Lakes Gamers would go onto create the greatest retro third party API website ever created, Great Lakes Games! We hope you see the passion and hard work we put into this project. Please enjoy our website!
